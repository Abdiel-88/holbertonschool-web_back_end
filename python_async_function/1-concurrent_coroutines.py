Description: Import wait_random from
the previous python file that youâ€™ve written
and write an async routine called wait_n that
takes in 2 int arguments: max_delay and n.
You will spawn wait_random n times with the specified max_delay.

wait_n should return the list of all the delays (float values).
The list of the delays should be in ascending
order without using sort() because of concurrency.
Arguments: n: int, max_delay: int = 10
